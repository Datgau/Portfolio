I spent three months learning programming fundamentals, exploring how the web works, and understanding the logic behind each line of code. After that, I devoted a full month to building this project completely from scratch. Every feature, every layout, and every bug taught me something new — not just about coding, but also about patience and problem-solving. It marks the first milestone in my journey and passion for software development, where I realized how powerful it feels to bring an idea to life through code.",
